# 💬 Twitter Sentiment Analysis (BiLSTM + GloVe + Streamlit)

> Analyze emotions behind tweets using **Deep Learning and NLP**.  
This project performs **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** using a **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** model with **GloVe word embeddings**, deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project classifies tweets into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments using a deep learning model trained on a labeled Twitter dataset.

- 🔠 **Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes tweets  
- 🧠 **Model:** BiLSTM with pretrained **GloVe (100d)** embeddings  
- ⚖️ **Balanced Training:** Uses `class_weight` to handle imbalance  
- 🌐 **Deployment:** Interactive Streamlit interface for live predictions  
- 📊 **Accuracy:** ~85% on test data

## 🧾 Model Training

Model training is handled inside **`twitter.ipynb`** and follows these main steps:

1. Clean and preprocess the dataset  
2. Tokenize and pad tweet sequences  
3. Encode sentiment labels  
4. Load pretrained **GloVe (100d)** embeddings  
5. Build and train the **BiLSTM** model  
6. Use `class_weight` to manage class imbalance  
7. Evaluate and save both the model and tokenizer

## 💻 Running the Streamlit App

Run the app locally using the command below:

```bash
streamlit run app.py


✅ **How to use it:**
1. Copy everything above (including the Markdown formatting).
2. Paste it directly into your `README.md` file.
3. Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
4. (Optional) Add a screenshot of your Streamlit app below the **Example Predictions** section for visual impact.

Would you like me to also give you a **short GitHub description** (the one that appears below your repo title, e.g. “AI-powered Twitter Sentiment Classifier using BiLSTM + Streamlit”)? It helps attract views.
